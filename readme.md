## Worldwide-Suicide-Overview-using-Machine-Learning ##

This project is an analysis of worldwide suicide rates using machine learning techniques. The analysis includes identifying the maximum and minimum suicide rates, gender analysis to determine which gender has the largest reported suicide cases, and age group analysis to determine which age group has the most reported suicide cases. Additionally, it examines the correlation between suicide rates and economic status, population density, and other factors.

The project utilizes several data structures, including AVL tree for sorting, doubly linked list for the main structure, hash table for searching, and heap (max heap) for max/min sorting (merge sort/bubble sort) and searching (linear, hashing). It also employs a linear regression model and deep learning tools and technologies to predict future cases with the help of gradient.
