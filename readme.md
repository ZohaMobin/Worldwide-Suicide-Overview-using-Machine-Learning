# Worldwide Suicide Overview using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is aimed at providing insights into the worldwide suicide rate using machine learning techniques. The following analyses have been performed:

- Maximum/Minimum Suicide Rates
- Linear Regression Model: Predicting future cases with the help of gradient
- Gender Analysis: Which gender has the largest Suicide cases reported.
- Age Group: Which age group has the most Suicide cases.
- Rich Countries and Poor Countries analysis of Suicide Cases
- Highly Populated and Less Populated Countries Analysis.

## Data Structures Used

- AVL tree: Sorting
- Doubly LinkedList (Main)
- Hash Table: Searching
- Heap (max heap): Max/Min Sorting (Merge Sort/Bubble Sort)
- Searching (Linear, Hashing)
- Linear Regression Model
- Deep Learning

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C++
- IDE: Dev C++ and Xcode (Mac-IOS)
